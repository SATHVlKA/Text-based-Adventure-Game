# Text-based-Adventure-Game
This is the second project for the virtual internship for the MotionCut internship for python programming.
This project is a fun text-based adventure game where the player is stuck in a time loop.
The player should make wise choices to break free from the time loop.
In this, the player is trapped in the time loop by the head boss named CHRONOS and inside a cave. 
The user is asked to make choices on which path to choose, who to meet and what they want to do.
The game can come to an end when the user meets a man names HERMES who leads him to the cave where CHRONOS is and there he meets an old woman who is need of his help.
Helping that old woman is the only way the user can break free from the time loop and successfully finish the game.
